# Interview Questions for Ex-USCIS Officer: Form I-134 Financial Documentation

## Background Context
We're building a K-1 visa application system to guide users through Form I-134 completion. We need authoritative clarity on what financial documentation is actually required and accepted in practice, particularly for asset verification.

---

## SECTION 1: ESTABLISHING THE FOUNDATION

### Understanding Your Role & Experience

**Q1:** Can you briefly describe your role at USCIS and how frequently you reviewed I-134 forms?
- What types of cases (K-1, humanitarian parole, other)?
- How many I-134s did you review per week/month?
- What years did you serve?

**Purpose:** Establish credibility and scope of experience to contextualize answers.

---

**Q2:** When reviewing an I-134, what is your PRIMARY objective?
- Are you verifying the sponsor won't be a public charge?
- Confirming financial resources exist and are accessible?
- Detecting fraud?
- All of the above - and if so, what's the priority order?

**Purpose:** Understand the lens through which ALL documentation is evaluated.

---

**Q3:** What percentage of I-134 cases that you reviewed actually REQUIRED asset documentation?
- In what situations did you look at assets at all?
- In what situations did you skip the asset section entirely?

**Purpose:** Understand whether assets are routinely scrutinized or only edge cases.

---

## SECTION 2: THE INCOME VS. ASSETS DECISION TREE

**Q4:** Walk me through your decision process when you first open an I-134 case:
- What do you look at FIRST?
- At what point do you decide "I need to see assets" vs. "income alone is sufficient"?
- Is there a specific income threshold or calculation you use?

**Purpose:** Understand the actual workflow before diving into documentation requirements.

---

**Q5:** For K-1 visas specifically:
- What is the poverty guideline percentage you're looking for (100%? 125%? Other)?
- If income meets that threshold with room to spare (e.g., 150% of guidelines), do you even review the assets section?
- If income is borderline (e.g., 105% of guidelines), does that trigger closer asset scrutiny?

**Purpose:** Define the bright lines that determine whether asset documentation matters at all.

---

**Q6:** If someone meets the income requirement through their tax returns and W-2s, but ALSO lists assets on the form:
- Do you verify those assets?
- Or do you essentially ignore them since income is already sufficient?
- Can listing assets with poor documentation hurt an otherwise strong application?

**Purpose:** Understand if it's safer to omit assets entirely when income is sufficient.

---

## SECTION 3: WHEN ASSETS ACTUALLY MATTER

**Q7:** In cases where you DO need to evaluate assets (because income is insufficient or borderline):
- What asset types do you see most commonly submitted?
- Which asset types do you consider MOST credible/reliable?
- Which asset types are often challenged or rejected?

**Purpose:** Open-ended discovery of what actually gets submitted, not what instructions say.

---

**Q8:** For the I-134 asset multiplier (assets divided by 5 = income equivalent):
- Is this calculation automatic, or do officers have discretion?
- Are certain assets excluded from this calculation (e.g., retirement accounts, primary residence)?
- What's the most common reason an asset gets excluded from the calculation?

**Purpose:** Understand how assets actually translate to financial capacity.

---

## SECTION 4: BANK ACCOUNT DOCUMENTATION - OPEN DISCOVERY

**Q9:** When someone lists a checking or savings account as an asset on I-134, what documentation have you seen submitted?
- Don't tell me what the instructions SAY - tell me what you've ACTUALLY SEEN in case files.
- What are the 3-5 most common types of documents people submit for bank accounts?

**Purpose:** Ground truth on actual submissions, not theoretical requirements.

---

**Q10:** Of those document types you've seen, which ones did you:
- Accept without question?
- Accept but scrutinize more closely?
- Reject or request additional documentation for?

**Purpose:** Understand what passes vs. what fails in practice.

---

**Q11:** The I-134 instructions ask for "a statement from an officer of the bank" showing:
- Date account opened
- Total amount deposited for the past year
- Present balance

In your experience:
- What percentage of applicants actually submit a document with ALL THREE of these pieces of information?
- What do the other applicants submit instead?
- How do you handle submissions that have 2 out of 3 pieces of information?

**Purpose:** Understand the gap between instructions and reality.

---

**Q12:** Have you ever seen a bank document that shows "total amount deposited for the past year" as a single calculated figure?
- If yes, what did it look like? (Bank letterhead? Specific line item?)
- If no, how did applicants demonstrate deposit history instead?

**Purpose:** Determine if this data point even exists or if it's theoretical.

---

**Q13:** When applicants submit regular monthly bank statements (the kind you download from Chase.com or Bank of America):
- Are these acceptable as-is?
- How many months do you expect to see?
- Do you manually review transactions, or just verify the current balance?
- Does submitting 12 separate monthly statements create problems vs. a single bank letter?

**Purpose:** Determine if monthly statements are a viable path.

---

**Q14:** How important is "date account opened" in your evaluation?
- If a bank statement doesn't show this, do you request additional documentation?
- What fraud patterns are you looking for related to account age?
- At what account age do you stop worrying about it being opened just for the visa?

**Purpose:** Understand if this is critical or just nice-to-have.

---

## SECTION 5: SPECIFIC ASSET TYPES - DOCUMENTATION REALITY

### Retirement Accounts

**Q15:** When someone lists a 401(k) or IRA as an asset:
- What documentation do they typically submit?
- Is a quarterly statement from Fidelity/Vanguard acceptable?
- Do you treat retirement accounts differently than regular bank accounts (since there are penalties for early withdrawal)?

**Purpose:** Understand actual retirement account documentation expectations.

---

**Q16:** Have you ever rejected a retirement account as an asset because:
- It wasn't "liquid enough" (penalties/taxes on withdrawal)?
- Documentation was insufficient?
- Other reason?

If yes, what would have made it acceptable?

**Purpose:** Identify failure modes for retirement accounts.

---

### Real Estate

**Q17:** The instructions say real estate requires "a recent appraisal by a licensed appraiser."
- What percentage of real estate submissions actually include a professional appraisal?
- What do people submit instead?
- Under what circumstances do you accept alternatives (property tax assessment, mortgage statement, Zillow estimate)?

**Purpose:** Determine if the appraisal requirement is enforced or aspirational.

---

**Q18:** For primary residence equity:
- Is this routinely accepted as an asset?
- Is it treated differently than investment property or rental property?
- What concerns do officers have about primary residence equity?

**Purpose:** Address the conflicting information we found about primary residence.

---

### Other Asset Types

**Q19:** For stocks/bonds/brokerage accounts:
- What documentation is typical and acceptable?
- Any concerns about market volatility between submission and review?

**Purpose:** Establish norms for investment accounts.

---

**Q20:** For personal property (second vehicles, valuable jewelry, collectibles):
- How often do you see these listed?
- How often are they challenged or rejected?
- Is the documentation burden worth the asset value, or do you advise against listing these?

**Purpose:** Determine if non-financial assets are worth the hassle.

---

## SECTION 6: DOCUMENTATION QUALITY & RECENCY

**Q21:** When you see financial documentation that's several months old:
- What's the oldest bank statement you'd accept without question?
- At what age do you start to worry the financial situation has changed?
- Does this vary by asset type (bank statements vs. retirement statements vs. property appraisals)?

**Purpose:** Define "recent" with actual timeframes.

---

**Q22:** What makes financial documentation look credible vs. suspicious?
- Specific formatting elements?
- Consistency across multiple documents?
- Red flags you look for?

**Purpose:** Understand quality markers beyond just content.

---

**Q23:** If someone submits a document that's clearly a home-printed statement (not on bank letterhead, not signed by a bank officer):
- Is this acceptable if it shows account holder name and current balance?
- Or do you require something more official?

**Purpose:** Understand the formality requirement.

---

## SECTION 7: COMMON FAILURE MODES

**Q24:** What are the top 5 mistakes you've seen with I-134 asset documentation that led to:
- RFEs (Request for Evidence)?
- Outright denials?

**Purpose:** Learn from real failures, not theoretical concerns.

---

**Q25:** Is there a difference between:
- Listing an asset with incomplete documentation (triggers scrutiny)?
- Not listing that asset at all (no documentation needed)?

In other words, can imperfect asset documentation make an application WORSE than omitting assets entirely?

**Purpose:** Understand risk of over-documentation.

---

**Q26:** Have you ever approved an I-134 where:
- Income was below threshold?
- Assets were listed to make up the difference?
- But asset documentation was imperfect (e.g., missing one of the three bank statement requirements)?

If yes, what made you comfortable approving despite imperfect documentation?

**Purpose:** Understand how much flexibility exists in practice.

---

## SECTION 8: PROCEDURAL & EMBASSY VARIATIONS

**Q27:** For K-1 visas, the I-134 is typically submitted at the embassy interview, not to USCIS directly.
- Do embassy consular officers apply the same standards as USCIS officers?
- Have you seen variations in how strictly requirements are enforced by different embassies?
- Which embassies are known to be more/less strict about financial documentation?

**Purpose:** Understand geographic variations in enforcement.

---

**Q28:** If an I-134 has issues, what happens?
- Immediate denial?
- RFE with opportunity to supplement?
- Accepted but beneficiary put on additional scrutiny?

**Purpose:** Understand consequences of imperfect documentation.

---

## SECTION 9: THE PRACTICAL ADVICE SECTION

**Q29:** Put yourself in the shoes of someone preparing I-134 in 2025:
- Their income is borderline (105% of poverty guidelines)
- They have $25,000 in a Chase checking account
- Chase tells them: "We can provide a letter with account opening date, current balance, and 12-month average balance - but not 'total deposits for the past year'"

What would you advise them to do?

**Purpose:** Get a specific, actionable recommendation for the exact scenario we're facing.

---

**Q30:** If you were designing our software to guide users through I-134 asset documentation, what would you tell us to build?
- What questions should we ask users to determine if they even need to worry about assets?
- What documentation should we tell them to gather for each asset type?
- What warnings should we give them about common mistakes?

**Purpose:** Translate expert knowledge into product requirements.

---

## SECTION 10: INCOME DOCUMENTATION (For Completeness)

**Q31:** Shifting to income documentation (separate from assets):
- What's the hierarchy of document strength for proving income?
- If someone submits tax transcript + W-2s + paystubs, which one do you trust most?
- In what situations do you need to see all three vs. just one?

**Purpose:** Establish income documentation best practices.

---

**Q32:** For self-employed sponsors:
- Tax returns can be 12-18 months old. How do you verify CURRENT income?
- What documentation bridges the gap between last tax return and present day?
- What triggers additional scrutiny for self-employment income?

**Purpose:** Address self-employment complexity.

---

**Q33:** If someone's income fluctuates significantly year-to-year:
- Do you average multiple years?
- Focus on most recent year?
- Require explanation for the fluctuation?

**Purpose:** Handle income volatility scenarios.

---

## SECTION 11: FINAL OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS

**Q34:** What's the biggest misconception people have about I-134 financial requirements?

**Purpose:** Identify blind spots in public understanding.

---

**Q35:** Between the official I-134 instructions and the reality of what you accept/reject, where is the biggest disconnect?

**Purpose:** Identify the instruction-to-practice gap.

---

**Q36:** If you could add ONE sentence to the official I-134 instructions that would prevent the most common mistakes, what would it say?

**Purpose:** Distill expertise into actionable guidance.

---

**Q37:** Is there anything I haven't asked about that you think is critical for applicants to understand about I-134 financial documentation?

**Purpose:** Catch anything we missed.

---

## Our Specific Challenge (Context to Share)

**What we're stuck on:**

The I-134 instructions ask for "a statement from an officer of the bank" showing:
1. Date account opened
2. Total amount deposited for the past year
3. Present balance

**Our research findings:**
- Major banks (Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo) offer verification letters showing: date opened + current balance + **average balance over X months**
- They do NOT provide "total amount deposited for the past year" as a standard data point
- Regular monthly bank statements show transactions but NOT account opening date or sum of deposits
- Immigration resources online just repeat the official requirements without explaining how to actually get this documentation
- Forum users report widely varied experiences with no clear pattern

**What we need from you:**
1. **The truth about what actually works** - not what the instructions say, but what you've seen approved
2. **Specific guidance for common banks** - what Chase/BofA/Wells Fargo customers should request
3. **The decision tree** - when assets matter vs. when they're ignored
4. **Red flags** - what triggers scrutiny vs. what's routinely accepted
5. **Practical workarounds** - when perfect documentation isn't available, what's the next best option?

**Our goal:**
Build software that gives users honest, accurate guidance based on what actually happens in practice - not just what the instructions theoretically require.
