# Task 0: Qualification Test Analysis (K-1 Path)

**Date:** December 11, 2025
**Purpose:** Understand what the qualification test already covers so the main questionnaire can build on that foundation seamlessly.

---

## What the Qualification Test Currently Covers (K-1 Path)

### ✅ **ALREADY SCREENED - High Impact Disqualifiers**

The qualification test already weeds out users who:

1. **Don't have eligible sponsor status** (Q1-Q1b)
   - One person must be U.S. citizen or LPR
   - K-1 requires U.S. citizen sponsor (LPR cannot file K-1)

2. **Wrong relationship status** (Q2)
   - Must be engaged or planning to marry (not already married)

3. **Beneficiary in wrong location** (Q3)
   - K-1 requires beneficiary outside U.S.

4. **Haven't met in person within 2 years** (K1-Q1, K1-Q1a)
   - Must have met in last 21 months OR planning to meet within 90 days

5. **Sponsor has filed too many K-1 petitions** (K1-Q2)
   - Can't have filed 2+ K-1 petitions in past OR had one approved in last 2 years

6. **SPONSOR has serious criminal history** (K1-Q3) ✅ HIGH IMPACT
   - Crimes involving abuse, sexual misconduct, or minors
   - Domestic violence, restraining orders
   - Homicide, rape, kidnapping, trafficking
   - Multiple (3+) alcohol/drug offenses

7. **BENEFICIARY has serious criminal history** (K1-Q4) ✅ HIGH IMPACT
   - Drugs, violence, prostitution, sexual offenses
   - Kidnapping, trafficking, money laundering
   - Human rights abuses

8. **Met through international marriage broker** (K1-Q5)
   - Paid IMB services disqualify K-1

9. **Income too low with no backup** (K1-Q6, K1-Q7)
   - Must meet income requirements OR have joint sponsor

### ✅ **ALREADY COLLECTED - Basic Information**

- First names of both people (Q4)
- Email address (Email Capture)
- Phone number (optional)
- Sponsor's annual income range (K1-Q6)
- Whether joint sponsor is available (K1-Q7)

## What the Qualification Test Does NOT Cover

### ❌ **NOT Screened Yet - But Could Be High Impact**

1. **Beneficiary's minor/less serious criminal history**
   - Traffic violations
   - Misdemeanors not covered by K1-Q4
   - Arrests without conviction
   - Old expunged records for minor crimes

2. **Beneficiary's immigration violations**
   - Visa denials
   - Overstays
   - Entry without inspection
   - Fraud/misrepresentation
   - Previous deportations

3. **Beneficiary's health issues**

5. **Sponsor's minor/moderate criminal history**
   - K1-Q3 asks about SERIOUS crimes only
   - Doesn't ask about minor misdemeanors, DUIs (if <3), etc.

6. **Sponsor's immigration history**
   - Has sponsor committed immigration fraud?
   - Has sponsor violated I-864 obligations before?

7. **Relationship authenticity concerns**

## Gap Analysis: What's Missing?

### **Issue 1: Redundant Questions**

The qualification test K1-Q4 asks about beneficiary criminal history (broad), but the main questionnaire Section 3.9 asks again in much more detail.

**Current Problem:** Users answer criminal questions TWICE
- Once in qualification test (broad)
- Once in main questionnaire (detailed)

**Feels jarring and repetitive**

### **Issue 2: Qualification Test Misses Some High-Impact Disqualifiers**

The qualification test currently does NOT ask about:

1. **Beneficiary immigration violations** - High impact!
   - Previous deportations (automatic bar)
   - Unlawful presence 6+ months (triggers 3-year bar)
   - Fraud/misrepresentation (often permanent bar)

2. **Beneficiary health issues** - Medium-high impact
   - Active TB (requires treatment before visa approval)
   - Drug abuse/addiction (may require evaluation)

These could disqualify users or require attorney consultation, but qualification test doesn't catch them early.

### **Issue 3: Qualification Test Criminal Questions Are Not Aligned**

**K1-Q3** (Sponsor): Very specific list (sexual offenses, minors, DV, homicide, trafficking, 3+ alcohol/drug)

**K1-Q4** (Beneficiary): Broad categories (drugs, violence, prostitution, trafficking, money laundering, human rights)

**Section 3.9** (Main questionnaire): Extremely comprehensive and detailed

These don't align well - creates confusion about what's being asked when.

## Recommendations for Improvement

### **Recommendation 1: Add High-Impact Immigration Screening to Qualification Test**

Add a new question K1-Q4a (between current K1-Q4 and K1-Q5):

**K1-Q4a. Has [FIRST_NAME_BENEFICIARY] ever:**
- Been denied a U.S. visa or entry at the border?
- Been deported, removed, or ordered to leave the U.S.?
- Overstayed a visa or stayed in the U.S. longer than allowed?
- Entered the U.S. without inspection (without seeing an officer)?
- Used false documents or given false information to U.S. immigration?

**Answer:**
- Yes → ❌ Terminate (with note: "Immigration violations can affect eligibility. Please consult an immigration attorney.")
- No → Continue to K1-Q5

**Impact:** Catches automatic bars early (deportations, fraud, unlawful presence)

### **Recommendation 2: Align Criminal History Questions**

**Option A: Keep Qualification Test Broad, Make Main Questionnaire Reference It**

- Qualification test: "Have you ever been arrested or convicted of ANY crime?"
- Main questionnaire: "Earlier, you told us [Name] has not been arrested or convicted of any crime. Let's verify this covers all situations USCIS asks about..."

**Option B: Make Qualification Test More Specific to Match Main Questionnaire**

- Update K1-Q3 and K1-Q4 to use the exact same categories as Section 3.9
- Main questionnaire doesn't need to re-ask, just confirms

**Option C (Recommended): Split into Two Stages**

- **Qualification Test:** Ask ONLY about automatic disqualifiers (serious crimes)
- **Main Questionnaire:** Ask comprehensive questions (all crimes, including minor ones that require disclosure but don't disqualify)

### **Recommendation 3: Add Health Screening (Optional - Medium Priority)**

Add optional health screening question:

**K1-Q4b. Does [FIRST_NAME_BENEFICIARY] have:**
- Active tuberculosis or other serious communicable disease?
- Current drug addiction requiring treatment?

**Answer:**
- Yes → Show note: "You may still qualify, but may need medical treatment or evaluation first. We recommend consulting an immigration attorney."
- No → Continue

**Impact:** Sets expectations early, but doesn't disqualify (health issues are often treatable)

### **Recommendation 4: Reference Qualification Test Answers in Main Questionnaire**

Instead of re-asking the same questions, reference what they already told us:

**Example in Section 3.9:**

> "Earlier, you told us that [Name] has never been arrested or convicted of crimes involving violence, drugs, trafficking, or sexual offenses. USCIS also requires us to ask about additional situations..."

Then ask about:
- Minor crimes not covered in qualification test
- Immigration violations
- Health issues
- Security concerns

**Impact:** Smoother flow, less repetitive, builds on trust from qualification test

## Summary: What Should Happen Next

### **For Task 0 (This Document):**
✅ Documented what qualification test covers
✅ Identified gaps and redundancies
✅ Provided recommendations

### **For Task 1 (Reorganization):**
Use this analysis to:
1. Avoid asking the same questions twice
2. Build on what users already told us in qualification test
3. Reference their qualification test answers when appropriate
4. Focus main questionnaire on collecting complete data, not screening

### **Optional: Update Qualification Test**
If you want to improve the qualification test based on these recommendations:
- Add immigration violation screening (K1-Q4a)
- Consider health screening (K1-Q4b)
- Align criminal history categories with main questionnaire

---

## Questions for User

Before we move to Task 1 (Reorganization), please decide:

1. **Should we update the qualification test to add immigration violation screening?** (Catches high-impact disqualifiers early)

2. **How should we handle criminal history questions?**
   - Option A: Reference qualification test answers in main questionnaire
   - Option B: Re-ask in detail in main questionnaire (current approach)
   - Option C: Update qualification test to match main questionnaire exactly

3. **Should the main questionnaire skip questions already answered in qualification test?** Or should it always re-ask for accuracy?

4. **Are there any other high-impact disqualifiers we should add to the qualification test?** (Things that would make someone ineligible or require attorney consultation)
