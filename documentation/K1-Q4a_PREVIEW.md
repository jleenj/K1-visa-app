## Visual Preview

Here's how the new immigration screening question will appear in the K-1 qualification test flow:

---

### **Previous Question (K1-Q4)**

**K1-Q4. Has the beneficiary ever been arrested or convicted of any crime involving drugs, violence, prostitution, sexual offenses, kidnapping, human trafficking, money laundering, or abuse of others' human rights — such as religious persecution, torture, or forced labor?**

*USCIS may screen for crimes from any country (U.S. or otherwise) and records that have been sealed, expunged, dismissed, or pardoned. This does not apply to most people but USCIS requires us to ask.*

**Your answer:**
- ⭕ Yes → ❌ Terminate
- ⭕ No → Continue to K1-Q4a

---

### **NEW QUESTION (K1-Q4a)** ⭐

**K1-Q4a. Has [Sarah] ever had any of the following immigration-related issues with the United States or any other country?**

*USCIS will conduct background checks and review immigration history, so it's important to answer truthfully. This does not apply to most people but USCIS requires us to ask.*

- Been denied a visa, denied entry at a port of entry, had a visa cancelled or revoked, or withdrawn a visa application?
- Been deported, removed, or placed in removal or deportation proceedings?
- Overstayed a visa or stayed in the U.S. beyond the authorized period?

---

**Your answer:**
- ⭕ Yes → ❌ Terminate
- ⭕ No → Continue to K1-Q5

💡 **Note:** Many immigration issues can be resolved with a waiver or legal assistance, but Evernest's guided application process is designed for straightforward cases. If you answered "Yes" to any of the above, we recommend consulting with an immigration attorney.

### **Next Question (K1-Q5)**

**K1-Q5. Did you and [Sarah] meet through a paid international marriage broker (IMB)?**

*(An IMB is a business that charges a fee to introduce U.S. citizens and green card holders to foreign nationals for the purpose of dating or marriage. This does not include general dating apps like Tinder.)*

**Your answer:**
- ⭕ Yes → ❌ Terminate
- ⭕ No → Continue to K1-Q6

## What This Question Catches

### ✅ **PROVEN/DOCUMENTED Issues Only:**

| Category | What It Catches | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Visa Denials** | Any previous U.S. visa denial (B-2, F-1, H-1B, etc.) | Creates scrutiny, may indicate inadmissibility |
| **Entry Denials** | Turned away at U.S. border/airport | Indicates serious issue (fraud, misrep, criminal) |
| **Visa Cancellations** | Visa revoked by consular officer or CBP | Usually due to fraud or eligibility change |
| **Withdrawals** | User withdrew visa application | May indicate problem they wanted to avoid |
| **Deportations/Removals** | Formal removal by immigration judge | Creates 5-20 year bars (or permanent) |
| **Removal Proceedings** | Currently in or previously in proceedings | May have existing bar or pending case |
| **Overstays** | Stayed beyond I-94 authorized date | Creates 3-year bar (180-364 days) or 10-year bar (365+ days) |

### ❌ **What We Excluded (Unproven/Voluntary):**

- Lived without legal status (no way to verify unless caught)
- Worked without authorization (no way to verify unless caught)
- Provided false information (if caught, would result in denial or deportation above)
- Used fraudulent documents (if caught, would result in denial or deportation above)
- Entered without inspection (if caught, would result in deportation above)

**Rationale:** If unproven violations resulted in consequences, they'd show up as denials/deportations. If they didn't result in consequences, USCIS might not know about them, and users might lie on a voluntary disclosure question.

---

## Expected Impact

### **Estimated Screening:**
- **1-3% of users** will select "Yes" and be terminated at this stage
- **3-5% of potential post-payment denials** prevented

### **Coverage Improvement:**
- **Before K1-Q4a:** 60-75% of disqualifiers caught
- **After K1-Q4a:** 85-90% of disqualifiers caught

### **User Experience:**
- Adds ~30 seconds to qualification test
- Prevents wasting time/money on ineligible applications
- Clear guidance to attorney referral if needed

---
