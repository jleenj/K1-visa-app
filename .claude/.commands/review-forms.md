Review the current questionnaire against the official forms and identify:

1. Any fields included that shouldn't be (not on official forms)
2. Any required fields missing from official forms
3. Variable naming conflicts or duplicates
4. Smart field types that could be reused instead of recreated

Be specific about form references (e.g., "Form I-129F, Page 3, Item 23").
